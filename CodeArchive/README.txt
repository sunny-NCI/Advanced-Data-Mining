
For simplicity, we have divided our work into 2 scripts:

- FinalModel.R: 
This is the code that is used to recreate our final model. This piece of code is also included in the CompleteWork.R script.
For simplicity, we have extracted only the necessary code for this final model here. This is also the same code that is shown in the presentation and which the report is based on.

- CompleteCode.R
This script is just to proof that we actually did the work that we stated we did in the report/distribution of work doc.
This is most of, but not all the code that we used to run all models that we produced.
This code mostly uncommented and messy.


- Presentation Slides
As there was no separate submission link for the presentation slides, we have included them here.
